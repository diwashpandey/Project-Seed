class ResponseUtilities:

        This provides the global response attributes

        How to use:
            1. Just inherit the class and work with the attributes
            2. use get_generated_response at last to get the generated response

        Customization:
            If you need to add more attributes or things in the response
            Simply override the get_generated_response and do just like you override other Class Based Views methods.
